# sudoku-solver
This stuff just resolve sudoku one finger in the nose

Hi, my name is RÃ©mi Lux. I'm currently an intern at Bertin IT, 
a society known for its main product : Media Centric.  
Welcome to my project

### What is it doing ?
My algorithm is using powerful IA to extract digits.
Then, it will simply regenerate your image with the solution

| Version | Before             |  After |
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
1.0 | ![sudoku_before_solve][imgSudoku0NotFilled] | ![sudoku_solved][imgSudoku0Solved]
1.1 | ![sudoku_before_solve][imgSudoku1NotFilled] | ![sudoku_solved][imgSudoku1Solved]

### Why is it unique ?
Try it, you will see

### Is it really Working ?
Yes, of course, and you

### Where can I find weights for the CNN :( ?
DO NOT WORRY BRO, I GOT YOUR BACK

### Actual solving logger
Load everything 	59.0% - 0.651s  
Grid Research 		10.5% - 0.116s  
Digits Extraction 	5.7% - 0.063s  
Grid Solving 		23.4% - 0.259s  
Image recreation 	1.4% - 0.015s  
EVERYTHING DONE 	1.10s

--> Except the importing phase (on which I am powerless), 
I will try to optimise each part of the process starting by the grid solving
### TODO LIST
- [ ] More Robust
- [ ] Faster
- [X] Better
- [ ] Stronger
- [ ] Video Live Solving

### VERSION LIST

- v1.1 : Use probabilistic Hough & detect grid better
- v1.0 : First version
